# Hops
#• Motivating Question: 
What question were you setting out to answer at the start of this project?

• Data Process: The centerpiece of your writeup should be a comprehensive discussion of your
process for sourcing, collecting, cleaning, and transforming the raw data into your final dataset. The
instructions should be clear enough that someone else could reproduce your process based on just the
readme file to obtain the same final results.

• Visualization: Choose and construct a single visualization to summarize and represent your data.
The production of the different types of hops grown in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. 
 Raw data collected from the USDA https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/s7526c41m

Cleaning Proceedure:

Arranged the years to individual columns next to each other by year

Erased any cells that had (D) or (NA)

Added the price columns for each year from the Hops Price Table

The following graph shows the 2018 highest grossing hops by State

• Analytical Technique: Apply one of the techniques that we have covered in the course to your
dataset and provide an analysis of the results. You can choose from either among the exploratory data
analysis topics or from the techniques we cover later in the course2

• Presentation: In the final week of class, you will give a three minute presentation3 about your
dataset and repository
